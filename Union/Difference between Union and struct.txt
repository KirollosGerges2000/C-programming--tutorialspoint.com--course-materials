Difference between Union and struct
1) Union has reserved its datatypes in the same memory location
 ,struct has not reserved its datatypes in the same memory location
  that may slow the response of Application in contrast of Union.
  
2) Union reserve it single data type in same memory location 
that may give me garbage value 
if I reserved diffrent type in contrast of struct.
